# PhenVar
PhenVar is designed to take one or more rsids and generate a list of PubMed IDs to query and generate novel associations between publications. It utilizes a local sqlite database in a configurable location to keep a local copy of relevant srids, pmids, and the abstract blobs for the pmids, which enables faster fetching of results.
The website portion of phenvar is powered by Flask.
## Installation Notes
Dependencies:
* Python 3.3+
* uwsgi + Nginx (for web)
* Sqlite 3

To install, clone the repository (ideally in /opt) and edit the settings.py file, replacing EMAIL with the email address you intend to use when querying NCBI.

Install python dependencies with:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

To initialize and load the database and json cache, run the following from the PhenVar directory (needs to be run from this directory due to relative paths):

`./manage.py initialize`

`./manage.py load`

`./manage.py build_json`

Note that the above will take quite some time (approximately ~1 day) due to the speed limitations of pubmed's API.

If the load command times out partway through, run:

`./manage.py resume`

To update the database with the latest data from PubMed (best to run this as a daily cronjob to avoid API timeouts from large queries), run:

`./manage.py update`

It may be necessary to restart your webserver for new changes to appear in the web.

Copy or symlink phenvar.ini to /etc/uwsgi.d/ and phenvar.conf to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ (assuming CentOS 7.x system) and restart nginx and uwsgi. 

It may be necessary to grant permissions to the uwsgi user to access the PhenVar application and log files (located at /var/log/uwsgi/phenvar.log).

## Accessing Data Via URL Parameters
The search form can be queried via the following url parameters from the /results/ location:

rsids: this is a list of rsids seperated by plus signs (when querying via url) e.g. 328+327+326

visualization: this parameter can be input multiple times for multiple visualization types; the available options are png-wordcloud, js-wordcloud, and js-graph for the wordcloud image, javascript wordcloud, and force-directed graph, respectively.

normalization-type: available parameters are default, rsid, article and article_count

for example, to do a search for rsids 326 and 327, with visualization options js-wordcloud and js-graph, using the article_count normalization option, you would input the following url:

https://phenvar.colorado.edu/results/?rsids=326+327&visualization=js-wordcloud&visualization=js-graph&normalization_type=article_count

## Application Structure

### settings.py
settings.py is a file containing various configuration options used by the application.
* EMAIL is the email address to use when querying NCBI, ideally this should be your email address
* WORDCLOUD_STORAGE is the path you wish to store your wordclouds in. The default is static/wc, which is recommended.
* MAPPING_FILE is a json file that is used to store nouns associated with preprocessed pmid's
* FILTER_LIST is a list of lowercase words to ignore when generating wordclouds

### ncbiutils.py
#### PubmedArticle
This object stores information about an article parsed from a PubmedArticle xml tree. It has the properties:
* pmid
* abstract
* authors
* date_created
* date_revised

And the method rsids(), which queries pubmed for a list of rsids cited in the article.
#### Author
Similar to PubmedArticle, this class is initiated with an Author xml tree from a pubmed article, and has the properties:
* last_name
* first_name
* initials

Or, if it is a collective author:
* collective_name

Both types of author have the *affiliations* property, which is a list of author affiliations parsed from the xml.
#### RSID
The RSID class takes an rsid number as input, and optionally gathers data about that RSID from SNP. It also has a method to return all associated PubmedArticles from pubmed.
#### get_pubmed_articles
Returns a full list of pubmed articles via the pubmed_snp_cited search term. Alternatively, only returns articles revised since the since_date variable (a python datetime.date object)
#### get_all_rsids
Returns full list of cited rsids from snp, as RSID objects
#### get_pubmed_article_from_pmid
Takes in a pmid and returns its associated PubmedArticle object.
### database.py
Contains the database schema definitions, using the Sqlalchemy ORM.
This also contains functions to perform language processing on abstracts in the database in order to create the cached json file, which contains lists of nouns in each article, linked by their pmid.

### visualization.py
Contains methods to create wordclouds from a list of rsids.
#### word_statistics
Method to create a dictionary of the form {"noun":[word count, article count, rsid count, weight]...} from a list of rsid's and a list of weights ('word_count', 'article_count', 'rsid_count', and 'rsid_balance'). The weights are used in determining how large they should appear in the generated wordcloud(s).

#### article_json
Takes a list of Article objects (from database.py) and builds a json object of the form {"nodes":[],"links":[]} for use in the D3 force-directed graph, containing information about rsid citations.
